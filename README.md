Here’s how to change your ChatGPT profile picture (DP):

On Desktop / Browser:

Open ChatGPT.

Click your profile icon in the bottom-left corner.

Click Settings.

Go to My profile.

Click your current profile picture.

Choose Upload photo and select your new image.

On Mobile App:

Open the ChatGPT app.

Tap your profile icon (top-right).

Go to Profile.

Tap your current DP.

Select Change photo and upload a new one.

If you don’t see the option, it may take a moment to appear depending on region/version.

You said:
theres no my profile in desktop
ChatGPT said:
No problem — the desktop UI recently changed.
Follow this updated method:

How to Change DP on ChatGPT (Desktop – New UI)
Open ChatGPT on your browser.

Look at the bottom-left corner → click on your name or email.
(It opens the side account panel.)

In that panel, click Settings (⚙️).

Inside Settings, go to General.

At the top, you’ll see your profile picture.

Click it → choose Upload photo → select your new DP.

If you still don’t see a profile picture option, it means your account is using the default OpenAI ID without profile customization enabled yet — some accounts are gradually receiving the feature.

If you want, send me a screenshot of the bottom-left area, and I’ll guide you exactly where to click.

this is my current profile looks like. but i want to make this attractive. how to do that?
ChatGPT said:
Here’s exactly how to make your GitHub profile page look more attractive — the professional way that recruiters, seniors, and contributors actually appreciate.

Your current profile picture is already strong, so the next upgrades should focus on your GitHub Profile README, repository presentation, and overall layout.

✅ 1. Create a Stunning GitHub Profile README
GitHub allows you to create a special repository with your username.
This README becomes the homepage of your profile.

Steps:
Go to GitHub → New Repository

Name it exactly your username → TausifLabs

Check “Add a README file”

Create a beautiful README with:

Intro section

Skills badges

Tools & technologies

Achievements

Stats card

Projects gallery

Social links

Want me to write a complete customized GitHub README for you?
Just say "Yes, write my GitHub README."

✅ 2. Add badges (looks professional instantly)
Example:

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=white)
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-007396?logo=java&logoColor=white)
![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-00599C?logo=c&logoColor=white)
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?logo=javascript&logoColor=black)
These instantly make your profile attractive.

✅ 3. Add GitHub Stats Cards
![GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=TausifLabs&show_icons=true)
![Top Languages](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=TausifLabs&layout=compact)
This shows activity and skills visually.

✅ 4. Add your best projects at the top
Use pinned repositories to highlight:

WebApp

Project CMS

BRACU-CSE

Software Papers

Any ML projects

Make them clean and professional with:

Clear README

Demo images

Proper description

Link to live demo (if any)

✅ 5. Improve your profile description
Replace:

he/him

Add a professional one-line bio:

CSE Undergraduate | Python & Web Developer | AI & Automation Enthusiast

✅ 6. Add social links
Like this:

[LinkedIn](your-link)
[Portfolio](your-link)
[Email](mailto:ittehadtausif@gmail.com)
Want me to redesign your full GitHub profile for you?
I can generate:

✔ Full GitHub README
✔ Badges
✔ Stats
✔ Project showcase
✔ Skills section
✔ Animated visuals
✔ Clean formatting
✔ Professional tone (matching your profile & achievements)

Just say:

"Make my GitHub profile README"

Or tell me:
Do you want it minimal, aesthetic, or developer-style (techy)?

You said:
✅ 2. Add badges (looks professional instant where to add these?
ChatGPT said:
You add badges inside your GitHub Profile README — not in settings, not in profile picture, but in the special README file that appears on your profile page.

Here’s exactly where and how:

✅ Where to Add Badges
Badges go inside:

TausifLabs / TausifLabs / README.md

This README is what appears as your profile homepage (above your repositories).

If you don’t have this README yet, here’s how to create it:

✅ Step-by-Step (Do This Once)
1. Create the special profile repository
Go to GitHub → New Repository

Name it exactly: TausifLabs

Enable Add README.md

Create the repo

Now GitHub will show a yellow box:

“You found a special repo… this README will appear on your profile.”

✅ 2. Open README.md
Go to the repo → click README.md → click Edit (pencil icon)

✅ 3. Paste badges anywhere you want
Example:

### 🛠️ Skills & Technologies

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=white)
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-007396?logo=java&logoColor=white)
![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-00599C?logo=c&logoColor=white)
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?logo=javascript&logoColor=black)
You can put them:

Under your introduction

Under "Skills" section

At the top under your name

In a separate badge section

Badges automatically become colorful icons on your profile.

If you want, I can generate a complete GitHub Profile README for you
Clean, professional, matching your CS background.

Just say:

👉 “Make my GitHub README”

You said:
i created this repo already and no option for adding a readme now
ChatGPT said:
No problem — you can still add the README manually.
Here’s the exact step-by-step:

✅ How to Add README After Repo Is Created
Method 1 (Easiest — Add New File):
Go to your repo:
https://github.com/TausifLabs/TausifLabs

Click the “Add file” button (top-right)

Select “Create new file”

Name the file exactly:

README.md
Add any content (even one line)

Scroll down → Commit new file

Done!
Your README will now appear on your GitHub profile homepage.

✅ Method 2 (If “Add file” isn’t visible)
Go to your repo

Click the Code tab

On the right side click:

“Add file” → “Create new file”
(or “Upload files” → upload a README.md from your computer)

🎯 Want Me to Auto-Generate Your Entire README?
If you want, I can create a full professional GitHub profile README for you with:

Badges

Skills section

GitHub stats

Projects showcase

About me

Contact links

Just say:

👉 “Create my GitHub README”

You said:
ok. now give me one by one instructions and provide the whole readme code at once
ChatGPT said:
Perfect.
I’ll give step-by-step instructions and then provide the entire final README code in one block so you can paste it directly.

✅ STEP 1 — Go to Your Profile Repository
Open this link:

👉 https://github.com/TausifLabs/TausifLabs

(This is your special profile repo.)

✅ STEP 2 — Create README.md
Click Add file

Click Create new file

Name the file exactly:

README.md
✅ STEP 3 — Paste the Full Code I Provide Below
